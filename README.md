# Atlantis
Atlantis is a travelling app that will send http requests to IATA’s API, return a JSON file of all airports in the country, and display all airports with pins that, once clicked on, will display information specific to the airport such as city, state, and distance away from user. The app uses network requests to pull information from IATA’s API, mapkit to display a map of all airports, and Core graphics library to draw lines on the screen. Additionally, this app gives the user the ability to select their preferred flight, and upon clicking will open a web browser within the app, allowing the user to book this flight.
